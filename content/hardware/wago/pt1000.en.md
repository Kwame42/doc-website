## 4-Channel Temperature Sensor Modules

A home automation system must gather information about ambient temperature, whether it's outdoor or indoor. Temperature acquisition is done through [PT1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_thermometer#Pt) temperature sensors. This input module accepts 4 direct connections of PT1000 temperature sensors. The connection is made with 2-wire probes.

The linearization across the entire temperature range is performed by the internal electronics of the module.

## Wiring

The wiring of the probes is done as shown in the diagram below.

The terminal has 4 status LEDs indicating whether the probe is correctly connected or short-circuited. If the LED corresponding to the input is red, there is a short circuit. If the LED is off, the connection is good.

## Heating Management

Heating management should be done with one temperature sensor per zone, coupled with an actuator (a binary output, for example). Usually, you can easily control a heating zone by connecting a solenoid valve to the desired circuit, then connect this solenoid valve to a relay output.

## Programming

Configuring an input is done using the [Calaos Installer]({{%relref "calaos_installer/wago" %}}) software. You will need the input number of the sensor. For example, in the diagram above, sensor 0 is connected to **analog PLC input 0** and sensor 2 is connected to **analog PLC input 2**. Proper labeling is necessary to know the number of each sensor.

Of course, the numbering starts with the first analog input terminal and continues with the following analog input terminals. So the first terminal starts at 0, the next one at 4, etc.
