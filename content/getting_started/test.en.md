## Turning on the Light

Now, you have the ability to turn on the light in different ways: first, through the switch, thanks to the rule we created earlier. Additionally, you can also directly control the light in one of the many Calaos interfaces. By directly controlling an IO, its state will be modified, and Calaos will manage it automatically.

It is important to note that not all types of IO are displayed or controllable in all user interfaces. Calaos offers several types of interfaces, including Calaos Home designed for touch screens, Calaos Mobile which is a mobile application available on Android and iOS, as well as Calaos WebApp, a web interface accessible via the IP address of your Calaos server at `https://<Calaos IP address>`
